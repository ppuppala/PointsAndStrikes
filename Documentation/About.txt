This project is addressed at making the process of keeping track of points and strikes for attendance of Consult Your Community at UMD members much easier and more automated. 

This system should be able to (at some point, not necessarily in V1):
	
	1) Keep a record of accumulated points
	2) Mark strikes against those that missed events without excuses (while keeping track of which ones are excused and which aren't)
	3) Send emails to those that receive strikes
	4) Notify executive leadership when someone receives three strikes
	5) Work on a semesterly schedule
	6) Provide a simple, easy-to-use interface

Future Upgrades:

1) Location based check-ins to figure out actual vs. expected? Could use bluetooth or something? Build this into an app, etc.
